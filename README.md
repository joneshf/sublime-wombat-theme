![Wombat Theme](http://d.pr/i/F9XH.png)

## Features

* Works for Sublime Text 2 and 3
* Highly customizable thanks to [Phoenix Theme](http://netatoo.github.io/phoenix-theme/) and [Soda Theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/wiki/Theme-customisation)
* Sets few useful default options (you can change them in the User config):
  ```
    {
      "auto_complete_commit_on_tab": true,
      "highlight_line": true,
      "overlay_scroll_bars": "enabled",
      "show_full_path": true,
      "tab_size": 2,
      "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
      "use_simple_full_screen": true
    }
  ```
* Any italics in Wombat theme are disabled. Everything's straight now.
* A bit darker background. I find it more easthetic and easier to read.
* Supports high resolution Retina displays.
* It's piÄ™kny it's beautiful.

## Installation

Install it by [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) and set following setting:

```
{
  "theme": "Wombat.sublime-theme"
}
```

You also need to restart Sublime Text.

## Customization

Wombat allows any config available in the [Phoenix Theme](https://github.com/netatoo/phoenix-theme). You just have to change the prefix from `phoenix_` to `_wombat`. Here are defaults set by Wombat:

```json
{
  "wombat_color_blue": true,
  "wombat_color_expanded_folder": true,
  "wombat_dirty_bottom_bar": true,
  "wombat_dirty_bottom_bar_blue": true,
  "wombat_sidebar_tree_small": true,
  "wombat_solid_current_tab": true,
  "wombat_tabs_medium": true,
}
```

You can disable them by changing `true` to `false` in your User settings.
